h1. House an asset management application

We are using some of the built in technologies of Mac OS X

* Quicklook to create previews of assets
* Spotlight to extract metadata
* SIPS (Scriptable image processor) to create thumbnails of asset preview


Where feasible we have tried to use built in technologies to reduce the reliance of third party libraries. Additionally *most* of the built in libraries/tools are heavily optimised for hte hardware they run on. (and so are *very* fast)
