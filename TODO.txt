Add in a run command for calling external commands
mainly

* unzip : for archives
* clipper : for previews
* sips : for thumbnails

Need to check the exit codes for the above processes

Site wide configuration for...
* location of assets (eg: outside of the webserver root)
* size and format of thumbnails (eg: gif or png)


All of these utilities should be installed in a location visible to the app (Rails.root)

Humanising metadata attributes


Assuming the following metadata

Audio channel count			| 2
Authors						| Band of Horses
Audio track number			| 1
Audio bit rate				| 210000
Audio encoding application 	| iTunes 
Recording year				| 2007
Musical genre				| Rock
Total bit rate				| 210000
Album						| Cease to Begin
Media types					| Sound
Duration seconds			| 61326


Attributes need to be grouped based on their "type"

Change the name of the attribute
Audio track number, Audio bit rate and Audio encoding application can loose "audio" from the start of their names. 
Duration in seconds could become duration
As we will convert the number into a string representing the duration. eg: 45 seconds



Grouping related attributes together
Attributes relating to width and height of a page should be displayed together


(This will change based on the format)
