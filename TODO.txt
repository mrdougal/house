Add in a run command for calling external commands
mainly

* unzip : for archives
* clipper : for previews
* sips : for thumbnails

Need to check the exit codes for the above processes

Site wide configuration for...
* location of assets (eg: outside of the webserver root)
* size and format of thumbnails (eg: gif or png)


All of these utilities should be installed in a location visible to the app (Rails.root)
